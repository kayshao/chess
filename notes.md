This is my notes file.

CLASSES AND OBJECTS
- Classes are capitalized, objects and functions are lowercase
- Every class has a constructor, default is used if not provided, default does nothing
- "this" is a pointer to current class, not necessary if there is only one 
- Copy constructor 
    . This(copy.value) calls regular constructor
    . Don't be repetitive, copy constructor helps eliminate that
