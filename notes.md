This is my notes file.
"As you develop your chess application you should consider keeping notes about the techniques and technologies that you
learn in the notes.md file that you have added."

PROJECT STEPS:
-
- run first test to find issues, fix each function that raises errors
- implement tostring early on to make errors easily readable

- create new PieceMovesCalculator class with subclasses for each piece, call from piecemoves function
- create constructors for each
  - then override hash and equal
